## Purpose

---

To be used for migrating from BitBucket to GitHub. Account issues with the BitBucket has forced us to move up our timeline to switch over to GitHub.
This script will clone/pull from a repo in BitBucket and push changes to GitHub. This will be used to keep repos synced so we can make the transition
from BitBucket to GitHub as seamless as possible. 

## Usage

---

Before running make sure that the `root_directory` in `git_info.yaml` exists and navigate to the directory where this script is stored.  
`python3 git_migration.py`
